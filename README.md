# Fathom

Hi. Fathom is a game development library, currently being developed for Haxe. If you're not a fan of Haxe, it also compiles to AS3, so you can use that too.

It's tested! How cool is that.

## Cool stuff

* `SuperObjectHash` - Did you know that Haxe doesn't provide a cross-platform TypedDictionary? `nme.ObjectHash` comes close, but silently screws up primitive key values (so ObjectHash<Int, String> would be a disaster). `SuperObjectHash` is what you want.
* `Set` - A collection of unique items, with some handy high power functions.
