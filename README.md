# Fathom

Hi. Fathom is a game development library, developed for either AS3 and JavaScript as suits your fancy. 

Games are built out of similar bits and pieces, but it's often difficult to see them through the mess of code. Fathom intends to expose this similarity and allow you to write objects as lists of behaviors. This allows for much more concise and beautiful code.

## Oh yeah?

Yeah. Check this out:
